This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a complex class name that contains special characters or spaces.  The `@apply` directive might not correctly interpret the class name, leading to unexpected styling or no styling at all. For example:

```html
<div class="@apply bg-gray-100 p-4 text-center mt-8 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  Hello, world!
</div>
```

If the complex class name involves dynamically generated classes or contains unsupported characters, the styles may not apply correctly.
