To solve this issue, avoid using complex class names with the `@apply` directive.  A cleaner approach is to either simplify your class names or apply the styles directly in your HTML, eliminating the need for `@apply` entirely.

Here's an example using direct styling:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 text-center mt-8 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  Hello, world!
</div>
```

This avoids the complexities of the `@apply` directive and ensures consistent styling.
